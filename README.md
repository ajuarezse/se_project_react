# WTWR (What to Wear) Project

The WTWR (What to Wear) project is a React-based front-end application designed to help users choose appropriate clothing based on real-time weather data. This project includes features such as generating a set of clothing cards from a hard-coded array and integrating a weather API to display the current temperature and location. Users can interact with the application by viewing the current weather conditions and selecting garments that match the weather.

# Key features include:

- **Clothing Cards**: Dynamically generated from a hard-coded array of data.

- **Weather API Integration**: Fetches and parsing data from a weather API to display real-time weather information.

- **Event Handling**: Implementing interactive modals for adding new garments and viewing garment details.

- **State Management**: Using React's state management to store and update temperature and location data.

# Technologies and Tools used:

- **React**: Leveraging React's component-based architecture for efficient UI development.

- **Vite**: Used for the fast and efficient build process.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language used in the project.

- **CSS**: Custom styling based on a provided Figma design.

This project was part of an assignment to create and style the front-end components for the WTWR app using React. I plan to expand this project with additional features and functionalities. The work Iâ€™ve done so far demonstrates my skills in React, API integration, and front-end development.
