# WTWR (What to Wear) Project

The WTWR (What to Wear) project is a React-based front-end application designed to help users choose appropriate clothing based on real-time weather data. This project includes features such as generating a set of clothing cards from a hard-coded array and integrating a weather API to display the current temperature and location. Users can interact with the application by viewing the current weather conditions and selecting garments that match the weather.

# Key features include:

- **React**: Leveraging React's component-based architecture for efficient UI development.

- **API Integration**: Calling and parsing data from a weather API to display real-time weather information.

- **State Management**: Using React's state management to store and update temperature and location data.

- **Event Handling**: Implementing interactive modals for adding new garments and viewing garment details.

This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development, including API integration, state management, and creating interactive components. You can view the live project [here](https://ajuarezse.github.io/se_project_react/).
