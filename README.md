# WTWR (What to Wear) Project

The WTWR (What to Wear) project is a React-based front-end application designed to help users choose appropriate clothing based on real-time weather data. This project includes features such as generating a set of clothing cards from a hard-coded array and integrating a weather API to display the current temperature and location. Users can interact with the application by viewing the current weather conditions and selecting garments that match the weather.

# Key features include:

- 👕 **Clothing Cards**: Dynamically generated from a hard-coded array of data.

- ☁️ **Weather API Integration**: Fetches and parsing data from a weather API to display real-time weather information.

- 🖱️ **Event Handling**: Implementing interactive modals for adding new garments and viewing garment details.

- 🔄 **State Management**: Using React's state management to store and update temperature and location data.

# Technologies and Tools used:

- ⚛️ **React**: Leveraging React's component-based architecture for efficient UI development.

- ⚡ **Vite**: Used for the fast and efficient build process.

- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language used in the project.

- 🎨 **CSS**: Custom styling based on a provided Figma design.

I plan to expand this project with additional features and functionalities. I'd like to add form validation and configure a responsive design. The work I’ve done so far demonstrates my skills in React, API integration, and front-end development.
